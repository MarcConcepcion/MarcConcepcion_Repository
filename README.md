# MarcConcepcion_Repository
Hi! I’m Marc Angelo Concepcion, a gamer and video/photo editor from Mamburao, Occidental Mindoro. I’m a BSIT 2C student at Occidental Mindoro State College. I’ve been editing videos for quite sometime now and taking photos. I love capturing real moments, building fun projects, and creating content for myself and my friends. Outside of editing, I spend a lot of time gaming, which inspires much of my creative work.

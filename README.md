# MarcConcepcion_Repository
Hi! I’m Marc Angelo Concepcion, a gamer and video/photo editor from Mamburao, Occidental Mindoro. I’m a BSIT 2C student at Occidental Mindoro State College. I’ve been editing videos for quite sometime now and taking photos. I love capturing real moments, building fun projects, and creating content for myself and my friends. Outside of editing, I spend a lot of time gaming, which inspires much of my creative work.

Reflection
Building my portfolio came with many challenges "many". The first big problem was CSS. I kept running into broken layouts, overlapping elements, and designs that didn’t look the same across devices. At one point, a section would look fine in Visual Studio Code but completely fall apart once I opened it in the browser and github. I solved this by going back to basics: breaking down the layout into small pieces, testing on both desktop and mobile, and relying on flexbox and grid for structure. It took patience and soo much time, but step by step the layout became stable.

JavaScript was another problem. Some of my scripts worked in isolation but broke when I connected them to the main portfolio. Simple features like filtering the portfolio grid or running the slider for education didn’t always run as expected. Debugging with console logs on the browser and checking for small typos helped me spot mistakes. I also tested code in smaller chunks before merging it back into the project which.

Transferring my work from Visual Studio Code to GitHub was the hardest part. Files broke often because of misplaced assets or incorrect paths. I learned the importance of keeping a clean structure and double-checking relative links. Each time I fixed a broken image or missing script, I got better at organizing my files. I have a feeling the code will still break but ill find it sooner or later.

Next time, I want to improve the portfolio by polishing the UI further, adding more projects with case studies in the later years, and making the contact form more user-friendly. Every error taught me something new and something i forgot, and that growth is what I value most.

ps. ui still broken
